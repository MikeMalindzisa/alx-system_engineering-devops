# This script demonstrates the use of a PID file, background process, and traps to handle signals.
# It creates a PID file, launches a background process, and sets up traps for SIGTERM, SIGQUIT, and SIGINT.
# When receiving a SIGTERM or SIGQUIT signal, the script prints "I hate the kill command," deletes the PID file, and exits.
# When receiving a SIGINT signal, the script prints "Y U no love me?!"

if [ ! -e "$file" ]; then

# Launch background process and store its PID in the PID file
sleep 2 &
echo "$!" > "$file"

# Set up traps to handle signals
# SIGTERM and SIGQUIT: Print message, delete PID file, and exit
trap 'echo "I hate the kill command"; rm "$file"; exit' SIGTERM SIGQUIT

# SIGINT: Print message
